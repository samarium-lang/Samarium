# File I/O

Files are handled through file I/O objects, which can be in one of several modes: read, write, read & write, append, and as either text or binary for each of these.
File I/O objects have a cursor, which is updated whenever data is written to/read from the object.
File objects are truthy when they are open.
The current cursor position can be gotten like so:

```sm
pos: f<<>>;
== assuming `f` is a file I/O object
```


## Creating

Files can be created with the unary `?~>` operator.
`?~> "file.txt"` will create an empty file called `file.txt` in the program directory.

!!! note
    Files will also be created if they are opened in write or append mode.


## Reading

Files can be opened for reading in two ways:

```sm
f <~~ "file.txt";
== opens `file.txt` for reading, in text mode,
== and stores the file I/O object in `f`.

f <~% "file.bin";
== opens `file.bin` for reading, in binary mode,
== and stores the file I/O object in `f`.
```

These file I/O objects can be read into a variable (a string for text mode, and an array of integers for binary mode) for use in the program.

```sm
string <~ f;
== reads the full contents of the file I/O object `f`
== into `string` (assuming `f` is in text read mode)

array <% f;
== reads the full contents of the file I/O object `f`
== into `array` (assuming `f` is in binary read mode)
```


## Writing

Files can be opened for writing in two ways:

```sm
f ~~> "file.txt";
== opens/creates `file.txt` for writing, in text
== mode, and stores the file I/O object in `f`.

f %~> "file.bin";
== opens/creates `file.bin` for writing, in binary 
== mode, and stores the file I/O object in `f`.
```

These file I/O objects can be written to from a variable (a string for text mode, and an array of integers for binary mode).

```sm
string ~> f;
== writes the entirety of `string` into the file I/O
== object `f` (assuming `f` is in text write mode)

string %> f;
== writes the entire contents of `array` into the file I/O
== object `f` (assuming `f` is in binary write mode)
```


## Appending

Files can be opened for appending in two ways:

```sm
f &~~> "file.txt";
== opens/creates `file.txt` for appending, in text
== mode, and stores the file I/O object in `f`.

f &%~> "file.bin";
== opens/creates `file.bin` for appending, in binary 
== mode, and stores the file I/O object in `f`.
```

The contents of these file I/O objects can be added to from a variable (a string for text mode, and an array of integers for binary mode).

```sm
string &~> f;
== appends the entirety of `string` to the current contents of
== the file I/O object `f` (assuming `f` is in text append mode)

array &%> f;
== appends the entirety of `array` to the current contents of
== the file I/O object `f` (assuming `f` is in binary append mode)
```


## Closing

Files can be closed with the `~` operator.
If files are not closed manually by the user, they will be automatically closed once the program terminates.
Note that the file I/O object will not be released from memory, but it still cannot be used.

```sm
~f;
== closes the file I/O object `f`
```


## Quick Operations

Files can be read from, written to or appended to directly using the filename, with quick operations.
These will open the file in the relevant mode, perform the operation, and close it, all in one.

Mode          | Operator
---           | ---
Text read     | `<~`
Text write    | `~>`
Text append   | `&~>`
Binary read   | `<%`
Binary write  | `%>`
Binary append | `&%>`

For example:

```sm
string ~> "file.txt";
== writes the entirety of `string` directly into `file.txt`

array <% "file.bin";
== reads the full contents of `file.bin` directly into `array`
```


## File Descriptors
You can also use file descriptors instead of file paths in order to access standard I/O streams.

Integer value | Name
:---:         | :---:
`\`           | Standard Input
`/`           | Standard Output
`/\`          | Standard Error

An example use of these could be printing without a newline at the end:
```sm
=> * {
    ... i ->? <<../\/\>> {
        i ~> /;
    }
}
```
The above code is equivalent to the following Python snippets:
```py
def main():
    for i in range(10):
        print(i, end="", flush=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
```py
import sys

def main():
    for i in range(10):
        sys.stdout.write(str(i))
        sys.stdout.flush()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
All snippets produce the following output:
```
0123456789
```
