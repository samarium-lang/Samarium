# Operators


## Arithmetic

Operator | Meaning
---      | ---
`+`      | Addition
`-`      | Subtraction
`++`     | Multiplication
`--`     | Division
`+++`    | Exponentiation
`---`    | Modulo


## Unary

Operator | Meaning
---      | ---
`+`      | Positive
`-`      | Negative


## Comparison

Operator | Meaning
---      | ---
`<`      | Less than
`>`      | Greater than
`<:`     | Less than or equal to
`>:`     | Greater than or equal to
`::`     | Equal to
`:::`    | Not equal to


## Logic and Membership

Operator                   | Meaning
---                        | ---
`&&`                       | Logical AND
<code>&#124;&#124;</code>  | Logical OR
`~~`                       | Logical NOT
`->?`                      | `x ->? y` returns 1 if `x` is a member of `y`, and 0 if not


## Bitwise

Operator             | Meaning
---                  | ---
`&`                  | Bitwise AND
<code>&#124;</code>  | Bitwise OR
`~`                  | Bitwise NOT
`^`                  | Bitwise XOR


## Assignment

All arithmetic and bitwise operators (except `~`) can be used together with the
assignment operator.

For example:

```sm
x: x - /\/;
x: x ++ //;
x: x --- /\\;
```

is equivalent to:

```sm
x-: /\/;
x++: //;
x---: /\\;
```
