# Enums

Enums are defined using the `#` character, before which comes the name of the enum.

Each of the enum members has to be separated with a semicolon.

By default, enum members are assigned increasing numbers, starting from 0.

You can provide your own values for enum members by simply assigning values to the names.

Enum members cannot be modified. Enums are truthy when they have at least 1 member.

```sm
Shape # {
    Circle;
    Square;
}

Color # {
    Red: "#FF0000";
    Green: "#00FF00";
    Blue: "#0000FF";
}

=> * {
    Shape!;
    Shape.Circle!;
    Shape.Square!;
    Color.Red!;
}
```
```
Enum(Shape)
0
1
#FF0000
```

Enums can be casted to Tables:
```sm
Shape # {
    Circle;
    Square;
}

Color # {
    Red: "#FF0000";
    Green: "#00FF00";
    Blue: "#0000FF";
}

=> * {
    Shape%!;
    Color%!;
}
```
```
{{"Circle" -> 0, "Square" -> 1}}
{{"Red" -> "#FF0000", "Green" -> "#00FF00", "Blue" -> "#0000FF"}}
```
